I Have created a minimalistic game where the player can run after a ball and push it into the goal, there are different levels with challenges that can be overcome.
1 Level, basics where you push the ball though the goal, player ball and out of bounds is showed on this level,
2 Level, here the first enemy challenges you, you must push the ball around the enemy and though the goal.
3 Level, here the enemy has learned the higly advance method of running so now you must take enemy positions into account to score a goal.
